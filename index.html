            Rent Buster NL was founded in 2022 in response to the Dutch housing shortage and the surge in rent prices. My goal is to seek out
            and alert renters who moved into new apartments/ studios/ rooms in the Netherlands that their landlord may be overcharging them. 
          </p>
          <p style="margin: 0;">
            While there may be a massive shortage of housing in major cities, a large portion of the rental market is subject to rent-regulation to
            ensure basic housing is affordable. Some landlords and estate agents ignore these price controls and grossly inflate the price
            of accommodation. Tenants are frequently unaware of their right to a rent reduction/fee refund or are too afraid to take action for fear of eviction, and are stuck paying thousands of euro extra per year. 
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 0;">
            I aim to inform and help as many of these tenants as possible via social media and mail. If you received a letter from me, then you likely are overpaying. Check out our FAQ for more information or send me a message for help.

            <div class="accordion-content">
              <p>The landlord/agency that has rented out the accommodation to you posted advertisements on popular housing websites that I check frequently. Your house/apartment was red-flagged as having suspiciously high rent. I performed a calculation and determined an approximate maximum rent price that you see in the letter. If the difference between this and the current rent price is within an acceptable level of accuracy, then I send a letter to your address a few weeks after the beginning of the contract. I do not know the name of the tenant or anything about the contract you signed. </p>

              <p>Unfortunately no, it must be calculated by hand. It varies depending on many factors and changes every year due to fluctuations in the house prices, the layout, the energy rating etc. The gemeente in Rotterdam and Utrecht offer a rudimentary calculator on their websites but they only calculate a possible range of values and only within their respective cities.

            <button type="button" class="accordionBtn">I think I am paying too much for my room/house/apartment but it took me months to find this place and I don’t want to upset the landlord and get kicked out for causing trouble. I would rather pay extra than lose this place. What will happen if I complain?</button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
              <p>That is understandable. Finding places to rent in the Netherlands is difficult and it is possible that undertaking this procedure will sour the relationship between you and the landlord. It is up to you to decide whether the financial savings of reduced rent (maybe thousands of euro) are worth the risk that the landlord will not renew your contract. Getting a new tenant is inconvenient and there is no guarantee that the new tenant will be willing to pay the higher original price. Landlords who have been in front of the Huurcommissie multiple times within 3 years pay a higher fee each time they lose the case.
                <br style="margin-bottom: 0.7rem;"> Also is only the case IF you have fixed term contract (less than 2 years) and you want to stay longer. If you have a fixed-term contract and you are sure you want to leave at the end of it, then you have no added risk to eviction. If you have an indefinite contract then the landlord will be powerless to evict you for appealing the rent price. You will likely be able to stay there as long as you want. Should the landlord try to evict you, you will have an arsenal of tenant rights to fall back on to prevent your eviction. As long as you keep your nose clean there should be no reason your landlord can evict you and most CERTAINLY not because you exercised your rights as a tenant.

          <div class="accordion" id="a6">
            <button type="button" class="accordionBtn">Okay, so what is your end in all this?</button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
              <p>I have had personal experience with dealing with bad landlords who overcharge tenants. I don’t like to see people get taken advantage of and I want to do something about it. Unfortunately it is not free to do this. I do want to do this full-time and, unfortunately, I am not a salaried employee of a rental organization. Operating a website, researching properties and sending letters costs money and I do have to pay my own rent and eat. With regard to how much, that is entirely up to you: I operate on money you donate from a successful settlement. If I am successful, I may be saving you thousands of euro per year. You can decide how much my services were worth to you. Similar organizations, such as Bumarang, demand for a large cut of the settlement (>50%) in exchange for the same service. </p>
            </div>
          </div>


          <div class="accordion" >
            <button type="button" class="accordionBtn">Why don’t I just go to a rental organization? Why do I need you at all?</button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
              <p>There are indeed many organizations that can help you with dealing with your landlord. Some of them charge for their services. They are also reactionary: They only respond to requests rather than the proactive approach taken by Rent Buster NL in seeking out tenants who don’t know they are overpaying.
                <br style="margin-bottom: 0.7rem;"> Of course you are perfectly capable of building your own case against your landlord. In fact, it is good that you show this initiative because the more people that do this, the better. My services are for those of you who dont have the time, energy or knowledge to deal with the paperwork, the back and forth with the landlord or the research required.</p>

            <div class="accordion-content">
              <p>Nope, it is not normal. According to a 2016 Supreme Court ruling, a makelaar/estate agent is forbidden from representing both sides in a contract. They can only accept payment from the side that they represent. If you found the ad for the apartment you live in on a website, this means that the landlord has already engaged the makelaar's services
			   and can only accept payment from him/her. Any fees charged to the tenant other than the rent are forbidden. This includes : key money, admin fees, registration fees, contract costs. There are many euphemisms for it. Most agencies do not charge these fees anymore but some are still trying to sneak them into the transaction, particularly if expats, who dont know the rules, are involved </p>
